# Salaries Prediction with Machine Learning models

Welcome to the Salaries Prediction Machine Learning repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive set of code for building and fine-tuning machine learning models to predict the salaries of Data Scientists with precision and accuracy.

## About the Project

The main objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can effectively predict the salaries of Data Scientists based on various features and parameters. To achieve this, the repository comprises three essential components:

1. **data_cleaning.ipynb**: This notebook serves as the first step in the data preprocessing pipeline. It focuses on cleaning the original dataset, handling duplicates, eliminating null values, and identifying and handling outliers. By ensuring data cleanliness and integrity, we lay the foundation for building reliable predictive models.

2. **EDA.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a pivotal role in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. This notebook is dedicated to visualizing the data through insightful graphs and charts, uncovering key insights, and providing valuable analytics for informed decision-making in the business context.

3. **model.ipynb**: The model notebook is where the magic happens! Here, we iterate between multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CART, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and AdaBoost. Through rigorous experimentation and parameter tuning, we strive to identify the best-performing model that accurately predicts Data Scientist salaries.
